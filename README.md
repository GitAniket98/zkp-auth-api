#  ZK-Auth: Zero-Knowledge Authentication System

ZK-Auth is a **privacy-preserving authentication system** that enables users to prove identity-related attributes without exposing sensitive data.  
It uses **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** to verify properties like **age, balance, membership, or KYC compliance**  without revealing underlying information.
